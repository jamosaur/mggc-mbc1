# MGGC X jamo_mods MBC1 carts

There are 2 versions of the MBC1 cart. The original one only supports up to 512kb roms (unless you feel like doing some hacky bodges), V2 has full support for 2mb roms.

## Version differences

### V1

These boards can be identified by the two solder jumpers at the bottom right of the cart.

**Only `AUD` should be bridged**, using `WR` is not advised.

### V2

These boards don't have any solder jumpers and are produced in purple.
